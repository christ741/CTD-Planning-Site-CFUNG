              <li> <strong>Client:</strong> Mr. Alan Lo, it will be very useful for Mr.Lo since he does not have the time to do study guides for students as he exclaimed and it will help his students improved their comprehention on the topic.</li>

                  <ol>
                    <li>To help AP Physics 2 Students who need extra practice for the Midterm, or those who are confused about a few topics.</li>
